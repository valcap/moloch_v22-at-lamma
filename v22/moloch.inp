 dtstep:  integration time step (in seconds)
 nadv:    number of advection steps in dtstep sec.
 nsound:  number of steps for sound waves
 nbl:     no. of lateral boundary lines
 nradm:   radiation scheme flag: 0 - no radiation,
                                 1 - Geleyn only every srad seconds
                                 2 - Geleyn and ECMWF combined
 hrun:    forecast duration in hours
 hist:    interval (in hours) between two writings of model output (mhf)
 hbound:  interval (in hours) between two boundary conditions
 hdiag:   interval (in hours) between two model diagnostics printouts
 srad:    interval (in seconds) between two calls of radiation-convection param.
          900. sec suggested if nlconv is true
          (meglio se srad*4 sottomultiplo di 3600 e multiplo di dtstep)
 mswshf:  interval (in minutes) between two writings of surface fields (shf)
 htop:    fraction of vertical column where microphys. and turbul. are
          active (<= 1.)
 nlmic2:  if true, 2-moment microphysics
 nlbfix:  if true, fixed boundary conditions
 nlana:   if true, saves initial condition in output (mhf)
 nltwice: it true, double computation of vertical advection per timestep
 nlhdiff: if true, computes horizontal turbulent diffusion
 nlconv:  if true, parameterization of convection is included
 nlord:   if true, orographic drag (block+GW)
 nlddamp: if true, explicit divergence dumping
 nlradar: if true, simulation of radar reflectivity
 nlwshf:  if true, writes surface fields (shf)
 mhfr:    1: full mhf resolution; 2: half mhf resolution
 hback:   interval (in hours) between two outputs of trajectory file
          (if negative, file is not written)
 hspray:  interval (in hours) between two outputs of SPRAY file
          (if negative, file is not written)
